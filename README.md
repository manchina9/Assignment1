# Introdution
As time advances, cloud computing is becoming a more popular solution, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. Nowadays most of the SMEs in Ireland are shifting towards cloud-based solutions due to its unique offerings. The implementation of cloud computing effectively replaced the obsolete traditional system and software for data management. The reason for comprehensive cloud deployment is associated with its low maintenance; it does not need any technical personnel to maintain IT infrastructure. In this current study, CurrencyFair is selected for investigating the effectiveness of cloud and non-cloud-based solutions. The research work will explore the current IT setup of the selected company along with proposing substantial recommendations for service level and other aspects of cloud infrastructure. 

# Background of the enterprise

CurrencyFair is a marketplace peer-to-peer company for the exchange of money, situated in Ireland. It was established by the co-founders' Sean Barrett, Brett Meyers, David Christian and Jonathan Potter in the year of 2009. In the year 2013, 30 new positions were presented by Enda Kenny an Irish. In the early time of 2014, it was the first SME to crack the barrier of 1 billion in transferring money and within 2017, in order to use it as a better form of SEM, the company Curencyfair refurbished itself. The mobile app for this company has been founded in 2015, September. The trade of the company has increased by a huge amount from 2016 to 2018 which is from 8 million to 7 billion in funding. Within 2018, the company proclaimed that they were extending their sector in the Asian market along with the payment convoy of Hong Kong with huge funding of 20 billion. In 2019, October, CEO Paul Byrne declared that 20 million in funding would be spent on the "Asian Gaelic games". In the past, as CurrencyFair already choose to expand its sector in the Asian market, that is within 2019, December the agreement with the Chinees had already been achieved. 
# Current IT setup

CurrencyFair is a company that has employees from all over the world such, as the UK, Greece, Singapore, Australia and Poland. The company in the current situation is providing their service to 19 countries all over the world. At present SME CurrencyFair employs a cloud system in order to transfer money. AWS is being used by the company. Having the right cloud partner is important as it affects the funding system. Version 1 has been one trusted partner with CurrencyFair in the cloud setup. In order to set up a reasonable IT setup in an SME, they need to first select the proper software along with that operating system and antivirus. For IT infrastructure, hardware requirements are needed the most in any SME as this is the foundation of any enterprise. After hardware, the software is the second most important factor for SMEs to build their IT infrastructure (Ajimoko & O, 2018). 
CurrencyFair right now uses the latest operating system of windows 10. As of now as no security flaw has been discovered in this version, which is why the company is utilizing this. As this company carries a huge amount of user data, the privacy aspect is a huge deal for them which is why antivirus software is crucial to install in the operating system. As every day the pieces of information and security dimensions change, that is why being notified about those is needful because if the system got out of date in there could happen data loss. The next most important factor is security. In order to maximise business security following some actions can be valuable for every small or medium enterprise. Steps, for example, tracking back up of the data already have, even not only in one place but in two different places as even from back up the data gets lost there will be another place it would be available. Another step would be installing some firewalls and flyers from some filters. The company CurrencyFair uses firewalls for protection it contains sensitive data for example user credit card information etc (Iswari et al., 2018).

# Recommendation

# The contrast of cloud vs non-cloud 
In the context of the cloud, with the help of hardware virtualization, the hardware systems can be turned into a virtual network. For example, virtual hardware, and virtual storage device. The hypervisor is the software that is used in the virtualisation of the hardware. In the case of non-cloud, the hardware there happens physical backup and also securing that is a lot more cost-effective. Combining software with the cloud reduced cost-effectiveness, increase mobility and flexibility etc. whereas even if non-cloud provides control over the own hands o the user but the license fee, and investment fee are high to bear. In security, the cloud has delivered its security in many ways and is trustworthy but in non-cloud infrastructures, security is a bug issue as data can get lost at any time (Xiong etal., 2019). 
# Deyployment

CurrencyFair being a money transfer application, there are more private and sensitive data to leak. Infrastructure with the cloud provides more security than the non-cloud. Cloud infrastructure has more advantages compared the non-cloud. Thus deploying the cloud infrastructure is more appropriate for SMEs like CurrencyFair. 
Justification 
The recommendation is to deploy the cloud system for CurrencyFair. As it has been demonstrated over time that the infrastructure with the cloud gives better security, even if it is considerably less cost-effective. Cloud-based software increase collaboration and for an SME it increases its earnings.
